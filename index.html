I'm especially interested in back-end development and data science, and am trying to gain experience in various different fields of computer science. This Fall I will be interning for FIS Worldpay, and I am very exited to work for such an fast-growing and influential company. Through the internship, I hope to apply what I have learned from my classes and personal projects into meaninful products and solutions. Outside of developing software, I enjoy performing and listening to music. I play the piano and sing in various UF groups, mainly the UF Concert Choir. I also love to play soccer and am a Chelsea FC supporter.

                <p>Programming Fundamentals 1 Teaching Assistant</p>
                <p>I acted as a teaching assistant for the course Programming Fundamentals 1 during Fall 2019 and Spring 2020. As a TA, I held a 2-hour lab as well as 2 1-hour office hour sections every week. I also worked alongside other teaching assistants and the professor to improve the way course material was presented and graded. My command of Java as well as my ability to convey complex ideas to students in an easily-digesteable manner improved greatly through this experience. One of the biggest revelations I had during this position is that when helping students you can't always assume what they are struggling with and talk their ear off explaining that concept, you have to listen to them about what they are struggling in and cater your explanation.</p>

                <p>This desktop application was the main project for the Performance Programming in Python course I took during the summer of 2020. I completed this project along with a group of 4 students, and it is easily downloadable and runnable from github. The application is designed to help musicians improve their intonnation in their practice sessions by giving users real-time and in-depth pitch accuracy information. I designed the gui for the application using the Python tkinter library, and I also helped connect the back-end of the applicaiton to the GUI.</p>

                <p>The sign language classifier was the main project for the Machine Learning in Python course I took in Spring 2020. To complete the project, our group created many different classifaction models for american sign language symbols, and compared their effectiveness. We tested the effectiveness of classifiers such as SVM, LDA + KNN, MLP, and random forest. In the end, we settled on using a convolutional neural network with three convolutional layers to classify the images. We chose to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) because of its ability to utilize locational information to process images. Our final CNN classifier had an accurary rating of around 90% for the letters a-h that we were tasked to classify.</p>

                <p>During the Swamphacks 2019 hackathon I worked alongside a group of 4 students from the UF club "Dream Team" to create an ipad app aimed to improve childrens' experience in the hospital. The app used exposure response prevention (ERP) to reduce the anxiety child patients would feel before medical operations. Although the app was not very technically difficult to create, I mainly just worked on creating images for the app, it was cool to work with such a dedicated team on an idea with real potential to improve the lives of others.</p>

                <p>During the Swamphacks 2018 hackathon, I worked alongside two other friends to make a social media app to facilitate group meet-ups. The app would allow users to place event pins on a map, and see the event pins of friends or strangers to see events going on around them. The goal of the app was to create a more connected community. I developed the mobile application using android studio and the google maps API. This was my first hackathon, as well as my first time making an app or using an API. I learned a lot from this experience, and it motivated me to participate in other Hackathons.</p>

                <p>8-week language-pledge Mandarin study</p>
                <p>The CET Harbin Mandarin program is very intense. It is 8 weeks of only speaking Mandarin, both with your professors and with other American students. Luckily, I had already studied 3 years of Mandarin and I felt comfortable making friends and talking with strangers. Living with a Chinese roommate during the program, and having a strong grasp of Mandarin allowed me to really recognize many of the differences between the lives of Students in China and the US. Although abiding by the language pledge was difficult, this program was very rewarding and it forced me to really improve my Mandarin level. It also gave me the opportunity to make many great friends from both China and other parts of the US.</p>

                <p>Studying abroad in Chengdu was my first time going to China. I remember being amazed at the size of Chengdu on the drive from the airport to the University. Similar moments of culture shock would become the norm over the next 10 weeks, as I'd learn more about a really unique city. Since my Mandarin level was very poor, having only studied Mandarin for one year, it was hard to have meaningful conversations with locals. Luckily, the other UF students studying abroad with me were all really fun, adn together we were able to travel and see many different Chinese cities. Together we travelled to Chongqing, Beijing, Xi'An, and experience everything from big-city clubs to small-town temples and wet markets.</p>

                <p>Studying at UF has been a very enriching experience. Due to its size, UF has an incredible amount of opportunities for those who seek them out. At UF, I have been able to take many risks and try things I never would have expeceted myself to try. I've started singing, studying Mandarin, acted as a Teaching Assistant, and I've tried out many different clubs from iprov to badminton. UF has a very diverse student body, which helps the campus to not feel like an echo chamber. There are groups at UF supporting all kinds of viewpoints, and UF feels like a place where many important discussions can take place. Even with its size, it is still easy to find a small circle of friends at UF if you are active on campus and explore what you are passionate about.</p>

                <p>Participating in the Rotary Youth Exchange program during my junior year of high school was probably the singular experience that has most impacted my personal growth. As a Rotary Youth Exchange student, I lived in Vigo, Spain for a year acting as a youth ambassador of the United States. Over the course of the year, my Spanish proficiency greatly improved, and I made close friends with both Spanish students in my classes as well as exchange students from countries such as Japan and Taiwan. As anyone will tell you, being an exchange student is not always easy. I battled homesickness, as well as dealt with many difficult (and embarrassing) situations. These challenges helped me mature, and have formed who I am today.
